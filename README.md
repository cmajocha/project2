## Details for teaching team
My XKCD password generator has the following error checking in place:
If a user leaves the input field blank, they will be given a directive to fill in a number between 1 and 9. Likewise, if they attempt to enter a number larger than 9, they will receive that same message. Since the input type is specified as number, they can not enter words or characters in the field.
